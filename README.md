# Data Science Resources (Mostly Free)

The first half is more or less my learning path in the past two years while the second half is my plan for this year. I tried to make a balance between comprehension and doability. For more extensive lists, you can check [Github search](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=awesome+machine+learning&type=) or [CS video lectures](https://github.com/Developer-Y/cs-video-courses)

Hope the list is helpful, especially to whom are not in CS major but interested in data science!

  * CMU 701 by Tom Mitchell: [Course page](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10701_sp11/lectures.shtml)

### - Textbooks:
  * Introduction to Statistical Learning: [pdf](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf)
  * Computer Age Statistical Inference: Algorithms, Evidence, and Data Science: [pdf](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI_files/PDF/casi.pdf)

  * Machine Learning Yearning: [Website](http://www.mlyearning.org/)

### - Comments:
Statistical Learning is the introduction course. It is free to earn a certificate. It follows Introduction to Statistical Learning book closely. Coursera Stanford by Andrew Ng is another introduction course course and quite popular. Taking either of them is enough for most of data science positions. People want to go deeper can take 229 or 701 and read ESL book.

### - Packages:
  * NLTK: http://www.nltk.org/
  * Standord packages: https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/

### - Comments:
The basic NLP course by Stanford is the fundamental one. SLP 3ed follows this course. After this, feel free to take one of the three NLP+DL courses. They basically cover same topics. The Stanford one have HWs available online. CMU one follows Goldberg's book. Deepmind one is much shorter.

## Deep Learning

### - Videos:
  * Ng’s deep learning courses: [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). This specialization is so popular. Prof. Ng covers all a lot of details and he is really a good teacher.
  * Tensorflow. Stanford CS20SI: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ0sVbIj3URf94DQtGPJV629ctn2c1zN-)
  * Stanford 231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (Spring 2017): [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv), [Couse page](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
  * Stanford 224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (Winter 2017): [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6), [Course page](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)
  * The self-driving car is a really hot topic recently. Take a look at this short course to see how it works. MIT 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeiKm4sgNOknGvNjby9efdf), [Couse page](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/)
  * Neural Networks for Machine Learning by Hinton: [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks). This course is so hard for me but it covers almost everything about neural networks. Prof. Hinton is the hero.
  * FAST.ai: [Course](http://www.fast.ai/)
  * IIT Madras - Mitesh Khapra's Deep Learning Course [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEAYkSg4uSQ1r-2XrJ_GBzzS6I-f8yfRU). This course is a somewhat rigorous Deep Learning course which covers Deep Learning - CNNs, RNNs, Attention Methods etc with Probabilistic Graphical Models. [Course Page](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/CS6910.html)

### - Books:
  * Deep learning book by Ian Goodfellow: http://www.deeplearningbook.org/. Very detailed reference book. 
  * ArXiv for research updates: https://arxiv.org/. I found it the mobile version of Feedly is useful to follow ArXiv. Also, try https://deeplearn.org/ or http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/top.

### - Other: 
  * LSTM: [My collection](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ml-4-shujian-liu/)

### - Comments:
Ng's courses are already good enough. Reading Part 2 of Goodfellow's book can also be helpful. Learning one kind of DL packages is important, such as Keras, TF or Pytorch. People may choose a focus, either CV or NLP. People want to have deeper understanding of DL can take Hinton's course and read Part 3 of Goodfellow's book. Fast.ai has very practical courses.
